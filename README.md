# Cafeteria App
The Cafeteria app aims to build a simple application for small scale hotels, restraunts etc. where they can receive orders from customers online instead of them waiting in a queue. This is specially useful in the COVID restriction senarios to ensure social distancing. 
<br/><br/>
This app was inspired by the thoughts of my friends and I about an app for our college canteen to take orders online. This was implemented as a mini project for my Lab course in college.
<br/><br/>
The app is written in Java using Android Studio IDE. The backend for the App is being implemented using Firebase.
Here are some snapshots of the App :
