# Cafeteria App
The Cafeteria app aims to build a simple application for small scale hotels, restraunts etc. where they can receive orders from customers online instead of them waiting in a queue. This is specially useful in the COVID restriction senarios to ensure social distancing. This app was inspired by the thoughts of my friends and I about an app for our college canteen to take orders online. This was implemented as a mini project for my Lab course in college.
The app is written in Java using Android Studio IDE. The backend for the App is being implemented using Firebase.
Here are some snapshots of the App :
