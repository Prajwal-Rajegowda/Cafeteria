# Cafeteria App ‚òï

## Introduction
The Cafeteria app aims to build a simple application for small scale hotels, restraunts etc. where they can receive orders from customers online instead of them waiting in a queue. This is specially useful in the COVID restriction senarios to ensure social distancing. 
<br/><br/>
This app was inspired by the thoughts of my friends and I about an app for our college canteen to take orders online. This was implemented as a mini project for my Lab course in college.
<br/><br/>
## Language and IDE
The app is written in Java using Android Studio IDE. The backend for the App is being implemented using Firebase.
<br/><br/>
## Note from the Authors
My friends and I who are the authors for this application do acknowledge that there are 1000 more better ways of implementing this app üòÅ. But we believe that our attempt can help others draw inspiration and improve upon what we have done.
## Further enhancements 
We discovered that the following can be implemented as further enhancements : 
- Payment Gateway
- Order Prep and Delivery Status
- Messaing and Email integration with invoice
- More UI Advancements and many more ...
